Create a class named "Student" that represents a student. The class should have the following properties:

Name (string): The name of the student.
Age (int): The age of the student.
Grade (int): The grade level of the student.

Step 2: Display Information
Implement a method in the Student class called "DisplayInfo" that displays the information of a student. The method should print the student's name, age, and grade level.

Step 3: Object Creation
Create three instances of the Student class, representing three different students. Assign appropriate values to the properties of each student.

Step 4:
Call the "DisplayInfo" method for each student to display their information.

Step 5: Run and Test
Compile and run the program. Ensure that the program executes without any errors and displays the correct information for each student.
